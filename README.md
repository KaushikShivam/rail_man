# Rain Man

It is a minimal weather project that I built using modern JS.

## It uses the MVC structure in a way that:
- ```Models``` folder contains Daily, Forcast, Search
- ```views``` folder contains forecastView, formView and a base file for all DOM elements
- ```index``` which is the controller file

## It uses technologies such as 
- Babel
- Webpack
- ESlint
- npm package manager
- ES6
- Modules
